# Games Development Portfolio - Stephane Emptage

## Introduction

I am a budding game developer, hoping to break into the industry. I am close to finishing an Apprenticeship in Software Development Level 4 (end date March 2021). I have been spending most of my free time learning C++ and the Unreal Engine. You can see some of my projects below and a description about what they do. **[You can check out my CV here](https://github.com/StefEmp/GamesDevelopmentPortfolio/blob/main/CV%20Stephane%20Emptage.pdf)** and if you want to know a little more about me **[you can find out more here.](https://github.com/StefEmp/GamesDevelopmentPortfolio/blob/main/Intro.pdf)**

## My Projects

### Overview

To translate my knowledge of object oriented programming from JavaScript and C# to C++ and the Unreal Engine I am following **[this](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/)**  course on udemy. I have avoided blueprint heavy courses for the time being. This is mainly because while blueprints are very useful (and I have been using them in a side project) I want to ensure I have a good core understanding of C++ as I understand that more complex work in the games industry relies upon C++ more often than blueprints.

I will over time be adding video links to showcase my understanding and also to hopefully make it easier for potential employers to see my projects without necessarily having to look through all my code (unless they want to!).


### Escape The Building - **[Code](https://github.com/StefEmp/EscapeTheBuilding)** 
This game is about escaping a building (I know, it says it all in the title!). I developed the gameplay mechanics on a test level. I created a basic room with a door and the player can place two objects on a trigger volume to open the door and escape. The mechanics I coded into the game were, door physics, linking a trigger volume to my door object and adding mass and gravity to the player pawn and objects. 

Following this I created a bigger level with some assets from the Unreal store. The player has to find two statues and put them on two different pedestals to open double doors and escape the dungeon.

While asset placement and texturing has been done in engine, the mechanics are done using C++ as opposed to blueprints. For example the door opening and closing mechanics are coded into the game using C++. This has been a fun project, where I have been learning about pointers, FVectors and implementing game designer friendly parameters using UPROPERTY. I really enjoyed towards the end of the projects having a go at level design and figuring out how to make a level look realisitic.


### Bull Cow Game - **[Code](https://github.com/StefEmp/BullCowGame)**
Bull Cow Game is set in a 3D world. You have a sign post which you can type into. Once in the game press TAB to use the terminal.
The basic idea is you need to guess the word. The word will be an "Isogram" an Isogram is a word that does not have repeating letters. 
The game is created using the Unreal Engine and C++, the functionality of the terminal has been coded using C++ while the 3D aspects are done using the Unreal engine, such as asset placement, lighting, terrain and map generation. The main purpose of this project was learn C++ and implementing things such as loops, functions, arrays and other useful forms of C++.


### Netrunner - **[Code](https://github.com/StefEmp/Netrunner)** - **[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcMQp_VILNs&feature=youtu.be)**
Netrunner is a basic game coded in C++. You are a hacker, you need to figure out the correct codes to progress. There are 5 levels to complete. The game is played in your terminal. I used this project to transfer my understanding of object oreintated programming from other languages to C++.

## Other Projects

### ReactSite - **[Code](https://github.com/StefEmp/ReactSite)**
ReactSite is a projected created by Stephane Emptage and Alex Paiu whilst training in their apprenticeship. It is a proof of concept to show the business a prototype of what a React based recruitment site would look like and how it would work, when the business eventually transitions to using React. Langauges used: C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Semantic UI.

### Soma - **[Website](https://soma10.bandcamp.com/releases)**
Soma is a band I sing and compose music for.

### The Wonky Gamer - **[Website](https://www.wonkyspanner.com/podcasts/wonky-gamer)** 
The Wonky Gamer is a podcast I host based on gaming news for the Wonky Spanner website.
