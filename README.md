# Portfolio: Games Development - Stephane Emptage

## Introduction

I am a budding game developer, hoping to break into the industry. I am close to finishing an Apprenticeship in Software Development Level 4 (end date March). I have been spending most of my free time learning C++ and the Unreal Engine. You can see some of my projects below and a description about what they do. 

## My Projects

### Escape The Building - **[Link](https://github.com/StefEmp/EscapeTheBuilding)** 
This game is about escaping a building (I know, it says it all in the title!). The game currently is set in a single building. The player can stand on a trigger button to open the door. While asset placement and texturing has been done in engine, the mechanics are done using C++ as opposed to Blueprints. For example the door opening and closing mechanics are coded into the game using C++. I am currently in the process of implementing physics and my next focus will be to apply weight to objects which can be placed upon the trigger volume. If the right weight is used it will keep the door open. This has been a fun project, where I have been learning about pointers, FVectors and implementing game designer friendly parameters using UPROPERTY. If your a potential employer, this project may be finished by the time you read this, as I am close to finishing.


### Bull Cow Game - **[Link](https://github.com/StefEmp/BullCowGame)**
Bull Cow Game is set in a 3D world. You have a sign post which you can type into. Once in the game press TAB to use the terminal.
The basic idea is you need to guess the word. The word will be an "Isogram" an Isogram is a word that does not have repeating letters. 
The game is created using the Unreal Engine and C++, the functionality of the terminal has been coded using C++ while the 3D aspects are done using the Unreal engine, such as asset placement, lighting, terrain and map generation. The main purpose of this project was learn C++ and implementing things such as loops, functions, arrays and other useful forms of C++.


### Netrunner - **[Link](https://github.com/StefEmp/Netrunner)**
Netrunner is a basic game coded in C++. You are a hacker, you need to figure out the correct codes to progress. There are 5 levels to complete. The game is played in your terminal. I used this project to transfer my understanding of object oreintated programming from other languages to C++.


## Other Projects

### ReactSite - **[Link](https://github.com/StefEmp/ReactSite)**
ReactSite is a projected created by Stephane Emptage and Alex Paiu whilst training in their apprenticeship. It is a proof of concept to show the business a prototype of what a React based recruitment site would look like and how it would work, when the business eventually transitions to using React. Langauges used: C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Semantic UI.


### Soma - **[Link](https://soma10.bandcamp.com/releases)**
Soma is a band I sing and compose music for.


### The Wonky Gamer - **[Link](https://www.wonkyspanner.com/podcasts/wonky-gamer)** 
The Wonky Gamer is a podcast I host based on gaming news for the Wonky Spanner website.
